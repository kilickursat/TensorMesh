Distributed FEM
===============

Three scripts in ``examples/distributed/`` cover the building blocks
for multi-GPU FEM in TensorMesh: graph coloring on the element
adjacency graph, spectral domain decomposition, and a
single-GPU-vs-multi-GPU assembly benchmark on a structured
tetrahedral cube.

.. note::

   The distributed layer is a research-grade path. It works, the
   benchmarks are real, but the public API is still settling — the
   :doc:`../user_guide/index` deliberately does not document it as a
   first-class workflow yet. Treat the examples below as recipes
   to learn from, not as a stable interface.


Element-graph coloring — ``graph_coloring.py``
----------------------------------------------

Race-free atomic-add assembly on GPU needs a coloring of the
element-adjacency graph: elements that touch a common DOF must
not share a color, so each color class can be scattered into the
global matrix in parallel. ``mesh.color()`` does this in one call,
running a parallel Welsh-Powell-style heuristic on the GPU when
available:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: examples/distributed/graph_coloring.py (essence)

   from tensormesh.dataset.mesh import gen_rectangle

   mesh = gen_rectangle(chara_length=1.0/50, element_type="tri")
   mesh.to(device)

   colors = mesh.color()                    # one int per element
   n_colors = colors.max().item() + 1
   print(f"Used {n_colors} colors.")

For a regular triangulation of the unit square the algorithm
typically finds 6–8 colors — close to the optimal chromatic
number for a 2D triangle adjacency graph. The visualization paints
each element by its color class, which gives the familiar
striped / banded pattern.

.. figure:: /_static/distributed/graph_coloring_result.png
   :alt: Triangular element coloring with 7 color classes
   :width: 75%
   :align: center

   ``graph_coloring.py`` output: a triangular mesh of the unit
   square painted by element color class. The Welsh-Powell
   heuristic finds 7 colors here; elements sharing a color
   never share a node, so each color class can be assembled in
   parallel without write conflicts.


Spectral domain decomposition — ``graph_partition.py``
------------------------------------------------------

For multi-GPU work the mesh has to be split into ``n_parts``
balanced subdomains with small interfaces. ``partition_mesh``
with ``method="spectral"`` computes the Fiedler vector of the
graph Laplacian and recursively bisects:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: examples/distributed/graph_partition.py (essence)

   from tensormesh.mesh.partition import partition_mesh

   submeshes = partition_mesh(mesh, n_parts=4, method="spectral")

The returned list of :class:`~tensormesh.Mesh` objects each carries
**ghost nodes** — the boundary nodes that belong to two subdomains
get duplicated, with their original global IDs stored in
``submesh.point_data["orig_nid"]``. The script's exploded-view
visualization separates the four subdomains in space and circles
the shared interface nodes — the geometric picture you usually
have to draw on a whiteboard to explain a domain decomposition.

.. figure:: /_static/distributed/graph_partition_exploded.png
   :alt: 4-way domain decomposition with ghost nodes (exploded view)
   :width: 90%
   :align: center

   ``graph_partition.py`` output: a 4-way spectral partition of
   the unit square in exploded view. Each subdomain is rendered
   in its own color; the highlighted dots along each subdomain's
   shared boundary are the **ghost nodes** — duplicated copies of
   the interface vertices that each rank owns locally, with the
   original global IDs preserved in
   ``submesh.point_data["orig_nid"]``.


Multi-GPU assembly benchmark — ``benchmark_assembly.py``
--------------------------------------------------------

The headline distributed-FEM benchmark. A structured tetrahedral
cube of size :math:`(n+1)^3` points and :math:`5 n^3` tets is
assembled (i) on a single GPU, (ii) across all visible GPUs via
``torch.multiprocessing``. The driver sweeps :math:`n` from a
configurable starting size until either path runs out of memory.

The interesting machinery lives in
:class:`~tensormesh.distributed.DistributedMesh`, which wraps the
spectral partition + per-subdomain ghost-node bookkeeping into a
single object:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: examples/distributed/benchmark_assembly.py (essence)

   import torch.multiprocessing as mp
   from tensormesh.distributed import DistributedMesh

   def _mp_assemble_worker(rank, submesh, device_id, q_order, return_dict):
       device = torch.device(f"cuda:{device_id}")
       torch.cuda.set_device(device)
       submesh.to(device)
       asm = tm.LaplaceElementAssembler.from_mesh(
           submesh, quadrature_order=q_order
       )
       K_local = asm()
       # …translate K_local.row/col through orig_nid into global indices…

   dmesh = DistributedMesh(mesh, num_partitions=num_partitions)
   manager = mp.Manager(); return_dict = manager.dict()
   procs = [
       mp.Process(target=_mp_assemble_worker,
                  args=(i, dmesh.submeshes[i], i, q_order, return_dict))
       for i in range(num_partitions)
   ]
   for p in procs: p.start()
   for p in procs: p.join()

A few details that matter:

* **One process per GPU.** ``torch.multiprocessing`` with
  ``set_start_method("spawn")`` gives each process its own Python
  interpreter, sidestepping the GIL. Threading would not help on
  CPU-bound assembly.
* **Ghost-node bookkeeping.** Each worker assembles a *local*
  ``SparseMatrix`` whose row/col are local DOF indices; the
  driver translates them through ``orig_nid`` into global indices
  before stitching the partial matrices together. The user-visible
  cost is a single GPU→CPU copy per worker.
* **Per-card memory.** The benchmark's "mem save" column reports
  ``single_gpu_peak / max_per_card_peak`` — typically close to
  ``num_partitions`` for the assembly step itself, since each
  worker only stores its own subdomain.

A representative slice of the output table:

.. code-block:: text

       n |   Points |    Tets | 1-GPU time | 1-GPU mem | N-GPU wall  N-GPU max_t  N-GPU mem/card | Speedup  Mem save
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      30 |   29,791 | 135,000 |    0.42 s  |    0.5 GB |     0.18 s     0.11 s         0.16 GB  |    2.3x      3.1x
      50 |  132,651 | 625,000 |    1.90 s  |    2.3 GB |     0.55 s     0.34 s         0.62 GB  |    3.5x      3.7x
      …   …          …          …            …            …            …               …          …          …

CLI:

.. code-block:: bash

   python benchmark_assembly.py                          # auto-detect GPUs
   python benchmark_assembly.py --partitions 4 --start 30 --max 200


Running the examples
--------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   cd examples/distributed
   python graph_coloring.py        # writes graph_coloring_result.png
   python graph_partition.py       # writes graph_partition_exploded.png
   python benchmark_assembly.py    # prints benchmark table

All three are lightweight and run on a single workstation; only
``benchmark_assembly.py`` benefits from multiple GPUs.


What's next
-----------

* :doc:`../user_guide/concepts` — the module map mentions
  :mod:`tensormesh.distributed` as a research path.
* :doc:`../user_guide/batched_workflows` — single-GPU batching
  patterns that often suffice before reaching for multi-GPU.
* :doc:`basics` — ``plot_mesh.py`` has the adjacency-graph
  visualizations these algorithms operate on.
