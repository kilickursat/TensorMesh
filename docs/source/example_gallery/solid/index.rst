Solid Mechanics
===============

Four worked solid-mechanics examples in ``examples/solid/``, built
as a progressive ladder — each rung adds exactly one new concept on
top of the previous one:

#. **Cantilever Beam** — linear elasticity, one direct solve. The
   baseline.
#. **Hyperelastic Beam** — finite strain (Neo-Hookean); introduces
   the L-BFGS energy-minimization recipe.
#. **Hertzian Contact** — adds a constraint (contact penalty) and a
   closed-form verification, reusing the same L-BFGS recipe.
#. **Plasticity (J2)** — adds path-dependence: per-quadrature
   history variables and a variational constitutive update, in 2D
   and 3D.

Together they cover the two solver patterns TensorMesh uses for
solid problems:

* **Direct linear solve** for small-strain linear elasticity
  (``cantilever_beam``).
* **L-BFGS energy minimization** for nonlinear problems where the
  potential energy is well-defined — hyperelasticity, contact, and
  plasticity (``hyperelastic_beam``, ``hertzian_contact``,
  ``plasticity_strip``).

The order below mirrors solver complexity.
